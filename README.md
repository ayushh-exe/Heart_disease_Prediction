# Estimation of Prediction for Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a logistic regression model, a widely used algorithm in machine learning for classification tasks. The notebook outlines a step-by-step approach to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize results.

## Getting the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide dataset source]. It contains relevant features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Identifies and addresses missing or null values in the dataset.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizes features to improve model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converts categorical data into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Generates plots to visualize distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
- Identifies patterns and outliers that may affect model performance.

## Model Training
- Implements logistic regression using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Key metrics to assess model performance.

## Visualization
- Includes graphs such as ROC curves, scatter plots, and bar charts to communicate findings effectively.
